    <h2>Updates (2019-03-02)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
        A lot of not so visible changes behind the scenes. The website now
        runs directly off of github, and has a more modern toolchain
        (Goodbye make, Perl and closure compiler, hello Webpack!)
        to facilitate development.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Performance</h3>
        In particular, the screen no longer redraws as quickly as possible.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
        Disk images can be dragged into the window to load them.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Contributions</h3>
        Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iflan">Ian Flanigan</a> for
        additions to improve ChromeBook behavior.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates (2017-10-08)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Better iOS support</h3>
        Bluetooth keyboards now work better.
        Reset is <tt>Ctrl-Shift-Delete</tt>. iOS now allows loading disks
        from iCloud and services like Drop Box. Saving locally is still not
        supported by iOS. I now understand why sound doesn't work, and
        I'm working on a work-around.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Source Maps</h3>
        Although the source code has always been available, by default
        I serve up minified Javascript for performance reasons. But now you
        can poke around more easily.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates (2017-08-31)</h2>
    (It's been a long time since I updated, so this is a rough list)
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Videx Videoterm Emulation (][js)</h3>
        PR#3 now does something on the Apple ][!.
      </li>
      <li><h3>AppleColor RGB Card Emulation (//jse)</h3>
        Now supports a bunch of the mostly non-standard video formats
        found on the AppleColor RGB card, including 16 color text, 16 color
        hires mode, and mixed black and white and color double hires
      </li>
      <li><h3>Machine selection</h3>
        You can now select between original, autostart and plus Apple ][s,
        and unenhanced and enhanced //es.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates (2013-07-04)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>RAMFactor Emulation (//jse)</h3>
        I now simulate having a 1 Megabyte RAMFactor card in slot 2.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Thunderclock Emulation</h3>
        There is cursory emulation of the Thunderclock card, enough
        to keep ProDOS applications from asking you to enter the date
        all the time. ProDOS attempts to guess the year from the month,
        the day and the day of the week, something that needs to be
        patched every 6 years. This means newer versions think it's 1996,
        older versions are stuck in the 80s.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Firefox Nightly Joystick Support</h3>
        Joystick support has yet to officially land, but the latest
        nightlies support the gamepad API.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates (2013-03-20)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Animation Frames</h3>
        I've switched from using setInterval() to requestAnimationFrame() where
        supported. This, in conjunction with the graphics re-write, seems
        to smooth performance and provide a more stable CPU speed.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Graphics Re-Write</h3>
        This (third) re-write of the graphics system should improve performance
        with graphics intensive programs. Rather than rendering each graphics
        update as it happens, updates are rendered each animation frame.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates (2013-03-12)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Apple //e</h3>
        After much flailing, and much staring at MMU emulation code in
        despair, I've finally published my Apple //e emulator. It's probably
        a little more rough than I'd hoped, but it has a lot of features
        that I really wanted to get into it, like basic double hires support,
        and it uses the enhanced Apple //e ROMs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates (2013-02-25)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Joystick Support</h3>
        Chrome only so far, the nascent gamepad API has finally allowed me
        to add basic joystick support. I can now re-live my glory days
        of Skyfox.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Re-written CPU emulator</h3>
        I finally got around to applying some of the many lessons I learned
        along the way writing my first CPU emulator in Javascript. The
        last re-working gave me about a 100% performance gain.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Finally Fixed Oregon Trail</h3>
        This seems to have been a major disappointment for many people.
        I was able to make it as a banker, but I'm embarassed to reveal my
        score.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Competition</h3>
        Now in addition to
        <a href="http://www.megidish.net/apple2js/">Gil Megidish's</a>
        Apple2JS, there's a couple of new kids on the block, including
        <a href="http://porkrind.org/a2/">David Caldwell's</a> Apple II+
        emulator where he's put a lot more thought into the graphics rendering
        than I have, and
        <a href="https://github.com/nicholasbs/appletoo">appletoo</a>,
        which I just stumbled across while looking for David's emulator and
        haven't had much time to look at.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>A Browser with HTML5 Support</h3>
        The most recent versions of
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">
          Google Chrome</a>,
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">
          Safari</a>,
        <a href="https://www.firefox.com/" target="_blank" >
          Firefox</a>, and
        <a href="https//www.opera.com/" target="_blank">
          Opera</a>
        all seem to work reasonably well these days, although
        variations in HTML5 support pop up, and occasionally a major release
        will move things around out from under me.
        IE prior to 9 lacks canvas tag support and is unsupported.
        <a href="https://windows.microsoft.com/ie9">IE 9+</a> renders nicely on
        a modern machine.<br/>
        <br />
        In updating this section I realized just how long
        I've been doing this, since I used to have to specify Firefox 3+ and
        Google Chrome 5+, and I'm now running Chrome 23 and Firefox 19.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Basic Knowledge of the Apple ][</h3>
        If you don't know how to use an Apple ][, this won't be much fun for
        you.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Lame Audio</h3>
        <span class="motter">Apple ][js</span>
        is written entirely using HTML5 and JavaScript, so I've avoiding using
        any Flash audio plugins. Most reputable browsers
        now provide some sort of audio API, but no standard really seems to have
        emerged. I should probably add a volume control.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Poor Printer Support</h3>
        I currently only support sending text characters to a separate window.
      </li>
    </ul>

            <a href="http://kegs.sourceforge.net/">KEGS</a>, because at some
            point I got so tired of futzing with ADC/SBC code I just ported
            the KEGS C code for those opcodes to Javascript so I could stop
            worrying about it.
